                        <p>
                            G.L.c. 186, §15 prohibits a landlord from waiving her liability for injuries,
                            loss or damage, caused to tenants or
                            third parties by her negligence, omission, or misconduct.

                            (Note that even if it is not explicitly stated,
                            it is implied under MA law). When your landlord rents to you, they are making an implied warranty that the premises are
                            fit for human occupation and that there are no health and safety violations at the time of rental.</strong>

                        <p>
                        In its landmark decision in Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway,
                        the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court determined
                        that when a landlord rents a residential unit under a written or oral lease,
                        she makes an "implied warranty that the
                        premises are fit for human occupation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Since the warranty of habitability legally holds for all leases in MA,
                        if your landlord does not keep your apartment in
                        livable condition they have broken the warranty of habitation, and you may pursue legal action. See more info here:

                        <h4>Covenant on Quiet Enjoyment</h4>

                        <em>
                            <span><strong>Your lease does not appear to contain language regarding the covenant of
                            quiet enjoyment. In the absence of specific
                            language, your rights to quiet enjoyment are implied under MA law.</strong></span>
                        </em>

                        <p>
                        According to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Simon v. Solomon, the phrase 'quiet enjoyment' signifies
                        "the tenant's right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy —
                        acts or omissions that "impair the
                        character and value of the leased premises." G.L.c.186, §14 penalizes any
                         landlord who willfully fails to furnish
                        water, hot water, heat, light, power, gas or other services, as required by
                         law or contract; who directly or indirectly
                        interferes with the furnishing of utilities or services or with the quiet
                        enjoyment of any occupant in the premises; or
                        who attempts to regain possession of such premises by force without judicial
                         process. The section also prohibits a
                        landlord from taking reprisals against a tenant who reports or issues proceedings
                        against a breach of the covenant of
                        quiet enjoyment. Eviction by the landlord, whether actual or constructive
                        (i.e., any violation of landlord's duties
                        which effectively deprives the tenant of her enjoyment of the premises),
                        constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet
                        enjoyment. Such a breach will entitle the tenant to triple damages or
                        three months' rent (whichever is greater), as
                        well as costs and attorney's fees. This covenant cannot be waived by the parties.

                            she makes an "implied warranty that the

                        <p>
                            The landlord's and tenant's maintenance and repair responsibilities
                            are mandated by the State Sanitary Code. The Code
                            places most of the burden of providing and maintaining the premises in safe and
                            habitable condition on the landlord,
                            while imposing only minimal maintenance obligations on the tenant. The landlord's duties include, inter alia, providing
                            and maintaining in good operating condition the water-heating facilities, electrical facilities,
                            drinkable water,
                            toilet and a sewage disposal system, and locks on entry doors. The landlord further bears
                            responsibility to maintain
                            structural elements in "good repair and in every way fit for the use intended"; and to install and"maintain free from
                            leaks, obstructions or other defects" sinks, bathtubs, toilets, gas and water pipes, and
                            other fixtures supplied by the
                            landlord. Lastly, the landlord has an obligation to exercise reasonable care to
                            ensure that the common areas under her
                            control are reasonably well maintained(88). The tenant, on the other hand, only needs to "maintain free from leaks,
                            obstructions and other defects" all "occupant owned and installed equipment";
                            to maintain "in a clean and sanitary
                            condition […] that part of the dwelling which he exclusively occupies or controls" ; and to "exercise reasonable care"
                            in the use of the structural elements of the dwelling. Tenant's benefits,
                            as set forth by the State Sanitary Code,
                            cannot be waived under any residential lease. Finally, the State Sanitary Code includes a "repair and deduct" statute,
                            aimed at enabling tenants to enforce landlords' compliance with the Code. It offers the tenant the ability to make
                            repairs and lawfully deduct the cost incurred from the rent or, alternatively, to treat the lease as abrogated and
                            vacate the premises within a reasonable time. These benefits cannot be waived by the parties.

                            MA statutes prohibit landlords from requiring, at or prior to the commencement of the tenancy,

                            the first month's rent, the last month's rent, a security deposit
                            equal to the first month's rent, and the purchase and
                            installation cost for a key and lock. Failure to comply with t
                            his provision constitutes "unfair or deceptive act."

                            Since 1969, a landlord is required to give a 14 days' notice in
                            writing before terminating the lease due to non-payment
                            of rent. A landlord is also prohibited from waiving the
                            tenant's right to cure the nonpayment by paying the amount owed
                            within the statutory reinstatement period.
